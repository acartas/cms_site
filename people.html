					<p><b>Ralph Dubayah: Principle Investigator </b> <br> Ralph Dubayah is a Professor in the Geography Department at the University of Maryland College Park, and a Fellow at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. His main areas of research are landcover characterization and the land surface energy and water balances. He leads a NASA EOS Interdisciplinary Science Investigation (IDS) on the use of remote sensing for macroscale hydrological modeling. Most recently he is the principal investigator for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL), the first NASA Earth System Pathfinder (ESSP) mission, which will measure the three-dimensional structure of the Earthâ€™s topography and forests. He serves in various U.S. national organizations, including the Remote Sensing Committee of the American Geophysical Union (chair). </p>

					<img src="images/hurtt.jpg" alt="George Hurtt" class="rightImg"/>
					<p><b>George Hurtt: Co- PI and NASA CMS Science Team Leader </b> <br> Dr. Hurtt is interested in the theory and application of community and ecosystem ecology. His primary approach is to combine mathematics and data to develop models for understanding and predicting the structure and dynamics of ecological systems. He has published on a wide range of topics including: the role of dispersal in the dynamics and structure of plant communities, latitudinal and elevational gradients in biodiversity, and ocean and terrestrial ecosystem models for use in studies of the global carbon cycle and global climate change. Current research is focused on the development and application of mathematical models to address issues such as: the sustainability of land-use practices, the effects of disturbances on ecosystem structure and function, and interactions between the biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.   </p>

					<p><b>Chengquan Huang: Co-Investigator </b> <br>Chengquan Huang has devoted a decade in studies of land cover and vegetation dynamics using remotely sensed data. He has been engaged in several projects that were national to continental in scale, including the USGS Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) 2001 project, the joint USGS-US Forest Service LANDFIRE project, the NASA LEDAPS project, and the NASA North American Forest Dynamics project. Currently he is leading efforts to quantify forest change at national to global scales using Landsat data, and is developing approaches for mapping forest structure and biomass change by integrating field inventory data, airborne or space borne lidar, and Landsat derived forest disturbance history. </p>

				<img src="images/duncanson.jpg" alt="Laura Duncanson" class="rightImg">
				<p><b>Laura Duncanson</b> <br> Laura received her Bachelor of Science Honours degree from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, where she worked as an undergraduate in a LiDAR remote sensing lab. She moved from discrete return LiDAR to waveform LiDAR (GLAS data) for her MSc at the University of Victoria. Her MSc thesis focused on using GLAS to model canopy height and biomass in high relief areas. Currently, Laura's research focuses on understanding forest structure and how it relates to forest dynamics, in particular biomass stock and flux. She is attempting to link waveform LiDAR to forest age and productivity, and is interested in exploring allometric scaling theories with remote sensing datasets.  </p>
