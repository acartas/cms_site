	    	<h2>The NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)</h2>
	    	<p>North American forests account for around 25% of the global terrestrial carbon sink and offset nearly 30% of the continental fossil fuel emissions (SOCCR, 2007). However, the extent and spatial distribution of these sinks and their future trajectory under various land use and climate scenarios is largely unknown. There is an urgent need for developing carbon monitoring capabilities to reduce these uncertainties and better understand the role of forests as carbon sinks in a changing climate. Precise and accurate estimates of carbon storage and fluxes are also critical for guiding forest management decisions, informing greenhouse gas reduction initiatives and climate treaties such as REDD+.</p>
			<p>Recognizing this need, the U.S. Congress mandated NASA to initiate work towards a Carbon Monitoring System. NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) is a forward-looking initiative designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The top-down or broad scale approach relies on satellite observations to quantify carbon storage and terrestrial carbon fluxes for national reporting. The bottom-up or fine scale effort focusses on mapping carbon stocks, uncertainties and sequestration potential at high spatial resolution for project level applications and national map validation. Together, the fine and broad scale approaches form a comprehensive carbon monitoring system.

			 <h2>Maryland Carbon Monitoring </h2>
			
			<p>The University of Maryland in involved in local scale carbon monitoring and led a pilot research effort in 2011 for two counties in Maryland. The project used existing, wall-to-wall airborne lidar coverage combined with other remote sensing and field datasets to produce countywide maps of carbon stocks and their uncertainties at 30 m resolution. These data were also used to drive a prognostic ecosystem model to predict carbon fluxes (at 90 m resolution). This work successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the local-scale approach and provided the foundation for a transparent and reproducible carbon monitoring framework. In the second phase of the research, the framework was expanded from two counties in Maryland to the entire state.</p>
			
			<h2>Research Objectives</h2> 
	
			<ol>
			<li>Improve our existing methodology for carbon stock estimation and uncertainty and assess its efficacy across an expanded range of environmental and forest conditions.</li>
			<li>Provide high-resolution estimates of carbon stocks and their uncertainties for the entire state of Maryland representing Eastern U.S. forest types.</li> 
			<li>Initialize and run a prognostic ecosystem model to estimate carbon stocks and fluxes, and to estimate carbon sequestration potential.</li> 
			<li>Provide detailed validation of national biomass maps using FIA data and high-resolution biomass maps.</li> 
		    <li>Demonstrate new data acquisition technology, micropulse single photon lidar (SPL), for low-cost, rapid large-area carbon assessments.</li> 
			</ol>
			
			<h2>Project Deliverables</h2>
